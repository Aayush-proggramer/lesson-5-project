                        <h2>Origins
                        The origins of hockey can be traced back to ancient Greece, Egypt, and Iran, where stick-and-ball games were played. The
                        first rules of modern hockey were established in the United Kingdom in 1876.<br> <br>
                        Popularity
                        Hockey is the second most played sport in the world, after football. It's played by over 3 million people in more than
                        100 countries.<br> <br>
                        Olympic history
                        Ice hockey first appeared in the Olympics in 1920, and women's hockey was added in 1980. In 1995, an agreement between
                        governing bodies and player associations allowed professional athletes to compete in the Olympics.<br> <br>
                        The Stanley Cup
                        The Stanley Cup was first awarded in 1892â€“93 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. Since 1926, the cup has been
                        awarded to the winner of the National Hockey League play-offs.
